For example:\n","\n","**num__emp.var.rate** had a strong negative effect (coefficient: -2.60), with an odds ratio of 0.07, indicating that a higher employment variation rate significantly lowers subscription likelihood.\n","\n","**cat__month_mar** had a positive coefficient (1.92), with an odds ratio of 6.79, suggesting calls in March were over six times more likely to result in a subscription.\n","\n","**Evaluation Metric:**\n","\n","**Accuracy** was selected as the primary evaluation metric for comparing model performance.\n","\n","Additional metrics included **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**, which are particularly useful in assessing model behavior on the minority (positive) class.\n","\n","**Metric Rationale:**\n","\n","Accuracy was prioritized due to the relatively balanced nature of the training data after preprocessing.\n","\n","F1-score was used to evaluate performance on positive class predictions, balancing both precision and recall â€” crucial for marketing conversion scenarios.\n","\n","**Model Performance Summary:**\n","\n","Model\t                  Accuracy (Test)\t   Precision\tRecall\t F1-score\n","K-Nearest Neighbors\t    90.45%\t           0.608\t    0.444\t   0.513\n","Logistic Regression\t    91.11%\t           0.669\t    0.429\t   0.523\n","Support Vector Machine\t91.11%\t           0.675\t    0.419\t   0.517\n","Decision Tree\t          91.50%\t           0.651\t    0.542\t   0.592\n","\n","The Decision Tree model had the best F1-score and recall, making it the most effective at identifying true positives (subscribers).\n","\n","Logistic Regression remains valuable due to its interpretability and solid performance.\n","\n","SVC achieved the same accuracy as logistic regression but is less interpretable.\n","\n","KNN, while performing well, had the lowest F1-score and recall.\n","\n","**Findings**\n","**Business Understanding**: The goal was to predict whether a customer would subscribe to a term deposit based on past marketing interactions.
